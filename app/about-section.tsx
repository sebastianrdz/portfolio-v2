      <p>
        As a recent computer science graduate with over 2 years of experience in
        web development, I have a solid understanding of both front-end and
        back-end development. I am passionate about creating engaging and
        user-friendly websites that deliver real value to businesses and their
        customers. My technical expertise includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, as well as experience with front-end frameworks like React,
        ReactNative, and NextJS. On the back-end side, I am proficient in
        programming languages like Node.js, Nest.js, and Express.js and have
        experience working with databases such as Postgres and MongoDB.
        Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in project management,
        problem-solving, and communication, which have enabled me to effectively
        collaborate with cross-functional teams and deliver high-quality results
        on time and within budget. As I continue to grow and develop in my
        career, I am excited to explore new technologies and take on new
        challenges. Let's connect and see how I can help bring your web
        development projects to life!
